    "Et factum est in anno quo mortuus est Ozias rex, vidi Dominum sedentem super solium excelsum.",
    "Quamdiu Osias rex vixit, non potuit visionem videre Isaias propheta.",
    "Erat enim Osias peccator, et faciens malignum ante conspectum Domini.",
    "Ingressus est templum et sancta sanctorum, et ob hoc lepra perfusus in fronte est.",
    "Tunc videmus, statim ut moritur Osias, gloriam Dei.",
    "Tantum hoc sit ut regnet in nobis sermo ejus qui dixit: Ego autem constitutus sum rex ab eo.",
    "Non ergo regnet peccatum in mortali vestro corpore.",
    "Miserabilis ille homo, cui peccatum regnat, qui tali se tradit regi.",
    "Voluptatis amator, non est amator Dei.",
    "Habent figurationem pietatis, virtutem autem ejus negantes.",
      "Haec propter mortem regis Osiae, post cujus interitum vidisse se ait visionem Propheta.",
    " Quae est autem visio?",
    "Vidi Dominum sedentem super thronum excelsum et elevatum, etc.",
    "II",
  "Non omnis qui videt Deum, videt eum sedentem super thronum excelsum et elevatum.",
  "Scio alium prophetam vidisse Dominum, et vidisse eum super thronum sedentem, sed non excelsum, neque elevatum.",
  "Disserens Scripturam Daniel, dicit: Throni positi sunt (Dan. VII, 9), et non erat excelsus ille thronus.",
  "Et veniam, ut sedeam ad judicandum populum in valle Josaphat.",
  "Ergo hic in valle sedit, et in valle eum judicaturus est, quem est condemnaturus.",
  "Aliud autem est videre eum sedentem super thronum excelsum et elevatum.",
  "Et in Michea: Egreditur et descendit Deus (Mich. I).",
  "Et ut videat Sodomam, descendit.",
  "Descendens, ait, videbo si secundum clamorem eorum venientem ad me, consummaverunt (Gen. XVIII).",
  "Igitur Deus aliquando sursum, aliquando deorsum juxta dignitatem videtur negotiorum.",
  "Vidi ergo Dominum, Isaias ait, sedentem super thronum excelsum, et elevatum.",
  "Si video Deum in his qui hic sunt regnantem, non eum video super thronum excelsum et elevatum.",
  "Si video eum regnantem coelestibus virtutibus, video eum sedentem super thronum excelsum et elevatum.",
  "Quid est quod dicit coelestibus virtutibus? Throni, dominationes, principatus, potestates, virtutes coelestes sunt.",
  "Et si video eum, quomodo eis regnet in Verbo: vidi Dominum sedentem super thronum excelsum et elevatum.",
  "Et plena erat domus gloria ejus.",
  "Sursum quoque elevatus est thronus ejus, plenaque est domus gloria ejus.",
  "Non arbitror, quia plena est domus gloria ejus haec quae in terra est.",
  "Domini est terra, et plenitudo ejus (Psal. XXIV).",
"III",
    "Plenitudinem autem gloriae Dei non invenies in praesenti, sed si quis aedificaverit templum Deo, videbitur gloria Dei, et si servat hoc quod dictum est, plena domus videtur gloria Dei, Nescio autem an sic domus gloria compleatur.",
  "Et in Levitico quantum ad praesentem pertinet negotium, Deo largiente, legitur in Collecta quae sequitur, quia praecepit Dominus quaedam fieri ut videatur Domini gloria.",
  "Nec unquam apparebit gloria Dei, si non haec fiant.",
  "Cognoscimus autem illa cum lecta fuerint.",
  "Et Seraphim stabant in circuitu ejus, sex alae uni et sex alae alteri.",
  "Duo video Seraphim, et unumquodque eorum in semetipso habens sex alas.",
  "Deinde dispositio alarum.",
  "Et duabus quidem alis velabant faciem, non propriam, sed Dei: duabus aliis velabant pedes, non proprios, sed Dei; duabus autem aliis volabant.",
  "Juxta quod scriptum est, contrarium sibi videtur.",
  "Si stabant, volare non poterant; scriptum vero est: Seraphim duo stabant in circuitu ejus, sex alae uni, et sex alae alteri, et duabus quidem velabant faciem, et duabus velabant pedes, et duabus volabant, et clamabant alter ad alterum.",
  "Verum haec Seraphim quae circa Deum sunt, quae sola cognitione dicunt: Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus; propter hoc servant mysteria [Al. mysterium] Trinitatis, quia et ipsa sunt sancta.",
  "His enim in omnibus quae sunt, sanctius nihil est.",
  "Et non leviter dicunt alter ad alterum: Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus; sed salutarem omnibus confessionem clamore pronuntiant.",
  "Quae sunt ista duo Seraphim? Dominus meus Jesus et Spiritus sanctus.",
  "Nec putes Trinitatis dissidere naturam, si nominum servantur officia.",
  "Operiebant faciem Dei.",
  "Exordium enim Dei ignotum est.",
  "Sed et pedes.",
  "Novissimum enim quod in Deo nostro est, non comprehenditur.",
  "Sola enim media videntur.",
  "Ante ista quae fuerint, nescio: ex iis quae sunt, intelligo Deum.",
  "Post ista quae futura sunt, juxta quod futura sunt, nescio.",
  "Quis pronuntiavit ei? Dixit Ecclesiastes: Annuntiate mihi priora et novissima quae erunt, et dicam quoniam Dii estis (Eccl. XIX).",
  "Hinc et Isaias ait: Priora annuntiate nobis, et ponemus cor nostrum, et sciemus, et novissima eorum quae ventura sunt, indicate nobis.",
  "Quae ventura sunt, in futurum nuntiate, et dicemus quoniam Dii estis (Isai. XLI).",
  "Ex quo si quis dixerit praeterita, et poterit novissima dicere, Deus est.",
  "Quis ergo potest dicere praeter Seraphim, Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus?",
  "Seraphim autem nudaverunt quamdam partem Dei, ut ita dicam, medietatem ejus, et clamabant aliud ad aliud assistentia Deo, atque dicentia, Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus.",
  "Stant igitur et moventur, stant cum Deo, moventur demonstrantia Deum.",
  "Intellige enim quia velant facies, velant pedes, non moventur quae velata sunt, non velantur quae volant, et dicunt: Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus Dominus Deus sabaoth, plena est omnis terra gloria ejus.",
  "Domini mei Jesu Christi nuntiatur adventus, nunc itaque plena est omnis terra gloria ejus.",
  "Aut certe necdum plena est, sed futurum ut impleatur, cum expleta fuerit oratio, qua patrem nos ipse Dominus jussit orare, Cum oraveritis, inquiens, dicite: Pater noster qui es in coelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum.",
  "Adveniat regnum tuum. Fiat voluntas tua sicut in coelo et in terra (Matth. VI).",
  "Adhuc in coelo voluntas est Patris, in terris necdum voluntas ejus expleta est, ut ipse Jesus juxta dispensationem carnis quam induerat, ait: Dedit mihi universam potestatem, ut in coelo et in terra (Matth. XXVIII).",
  "Numquid potestatem non habet in terra is qui habebat in coelis? et aliquid de mundo acciperet, qui in sua venerat?",
  "Sed ut ita crederetur Deus in terra, quomodo credebatur in coelo, ergo accepit potestatem homo Christus, quam ante non habuit, et usque ad praesens necdum habet in terra omnium potestatem.",
  "In his quippe qui peccant, necdum regnat; sed quando ei data est et horum potestas, cum ei subdita fuerint omnia, tunc complebitur potestas, et perambulabit subjiciens sibi omnia (I Cor. XV).",
  "Quidam autem necdum volunt subjici ei, verum adhuc inimicis ejus subjiciuntur.",
  "Nos porro dicamus: Nonne Deo subjecta erit anima mea (Psal. LIII)? apud Deum enim salutare meum.",
   "IV",
  "Et duabus volabant, et dicebat alter ad alterum: Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth: plena est omnis terra gloria ejus.",
  "Et elevatum est superliminare a voce qua clamabant: voce Jesu Christi et voce Spiritus sancti.",
  "Si aliquis e nobis clamantium audierit vocem Jesu Christi et Spiritus sancti, elevatur superliminare, et altius fit quam eo tempore cum elevatum est, cumque dictum est: Attollite portas, principes, vestras, et elevamini portae aeternales, et introibit rex gloriae (Psal. XXIV).",
  "Et domus impleta est fumo. Ex remissione ignis cuncta impleta est domus.",
  "Fumus autem vapor ignis est.",
  "Et dixi: O miser ego, quoniam compunctus sum, quia cum sim homo, et immunda labia habeam.",
  "Non possum sentire quare humiliaverit seipsum Isaias. Verum dicit: testimonium enim dat Scriptura, quia ejus mundantur labia ab uno ex Seraphim, qui missus est ad auferenda ejus peccata.",
  "Unus autem ex Seraphim Dominus meus Jesus Christus est, qui ad auferenda peccata nostra a Patre missus est, et dicit: Ecce abstuli iniquitates tuas, et peccata tua circummundavi.",
  "Nec putes naturae contumeliam, si Filius a Patre mittitur.",
  "Denique ut Unitatem deitatis in Trinitate cognoscas, solus Christus in praesenti lectione nunc peccata dimittit, et tamen certum est a Trinitate peccata dimitti.",
  "Qui enim in uno crediderit, credit in omnibus.",
  "Deferatur ergo mihi de altario coelesti forceps ut tangat labia mea.",
  "Forceps Domini si tetigit labia mea, mundat ea.",
  "Etsi mundaverit ea, et circumciderit a vitiis, ut nuper diximus, aperiam verbo Dei os meum, nec ulterius sermo immundus exiet ex ore meo: quia cum sim homo, et immunda labia habeam, in medio quoque populi immunda labia habentis habito.",
  "Seraphim quod missum fuit, mundavit labia Prophetae, non mundavit autem labia populi.",
  "Confessus est enim ipse immunda labia se habere, et in medio populi immunda labia habentis habitare.",
  "Sed hoc quod missum est Seraphim, non judicavit dignos esse de populo, ut et illorum labia emundaret, et idcirco adhuc impie agunt, idcirco adhuc Domino meo Jesu Christo repugnant, adhuc ei maledicunt immundis labiis.",
  "Ego autem precor, ut veniens Seraphim, emundet labia mea.",
"V",
  "Et duabus volabant, et dicebat alter ad alterum: Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth: plena est omnis terra gloria ejus.",

    "I",
    "And it happened in the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a high throne.",
    "As long as King Uzziah lived, the prophet Isaiah could not see the vision.",
    "For Uzziah was a sinner, doing evil in the sight of the Lord.",
    "He entered the temple and the Holy of Holies, and because of this, was struck with leprosy on his forehead.",
    "Then we see — as soon as Uzziah dies — the glory of God.",
    "Let it be only this: that His word may reign in us, He who said: 'I was appointed king by Him.'",
    "Therefore, let sin not reign in your mortal body.",
    "Wretched is the man ruled by sin, who gives himself to such a king.",
    "A lover of pleasure is not a lover of God.",
    "They have the form of godliness but deny its power.",
      "This was because of the death of King Uzziah,after whose passing the Prophet says he saw the vision.",
    "And what is the vision?",
    "I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and exalted throne, etc.",
    "II",
    "Not everyone who sees God sees Him sitting upon a high and exalted throne.",
  "I know another prophet who saw the Lord and saw Him seated upon a throne, but not high nor exalted.",
  "Discussing Scripture, Daniel says: Thrones were set in place (Dan. 7:9), and that throne was not high.",
  "And I will come to sit in judgment upon the people in the valley of Jehoshaphat.",
  "Therefore He sat here in the valley, and in the valley He will judge the one whom He is to condemn.",
  "But it is another thing to see Him sitting upon a high and exalted throne.",
  "And in Micah: God goes forth and descends (Micah 1).",
  "And in order to see Sodom, He descended.",
  "Descending, He said: I will see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry which has come to Me (Gen. 18).",
  "Therefore, God is seen sometimes above, sometimes below, according to the dignity of the matters at hand.",
  "I saw the Lord, says Isaiah, sitting upon a high and exalted throne.",
  "If I see God reigning among those here on earth, I do not see Him upon a high and exalted throne.",
  "If I see Him reigning over the heavenly powers, I see Him sitting upon a high and exalted throne.",
  "What does he mean by heavenly powers? Thrones, dominions, principalities, powers — these are heavenly powers.",
  "And if I see how He reigns over them through the Word: I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and exalted throne.",
  "And the house was full of His glory.",
  "His throne was also lifted up on high, and the house was full of His glory.",
  "I do not think that this house on earth is the one full of His glory.",
  "The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof (Psalm 24).",
    "III",
  "But you will not find the fullness of God's glory in the present, but if anyone builds a temple to God, God's glory will be seen, and if one keeps what has been said, the house is filled with God's glory. I do not know, however, if the house of glory will be completed in this way.",
  "And in Leviticus, as far as the present matter pertains, with God's help, it is read in the following Collect that the Lord commanded certain things to be done so that the glory of the Lord may be seen.",
  "God's glory will never appear if these things are not done.",
  "But we will recognize them when they have been read.",
  "And the Seraphim stood around Him, six wings on one and six wings on the other.",
  "I see two Seraphim, and each of them having six wings.",
  "Then the arrangement of the wings.",
  "With two wings they covered their faces, not their own, but God's; with two they covered their feet, not their own, but God's; and with two they flew.",
  "According to what is written, it seems contrary to itself.",
  "If they stood, they could not fly; but it is written: Two Seraphim stood around Him, six wings on one, and six wings on the other, with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew, and they called to each other.",
  "But these Seraphim who are around God, who alone declare with knowledge: Holy, holy, holy; for this reason they preserve the mysteries of the Trinity, because they themselves are holy.",
  "For in all that exists, nothing is more holy than these.",
  "And they do not lightly say to one another: Holy, holy, holy; but they proclaim the saving confession with a loud cry.",
  "Who are these two Seraphim? My Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit.",
  "Do not think that the nature of the Trinity is in disagreement if the offices of the names are preserved.",
  "They covered God's face.",
  "For the beginning of God is unknown.",
  "And His feet as well.",
  "For the most distant thing in our God is incomprehensible.",
  "Only the middle is seen.",
  "Before those things which have been, I do not know; from those that are, I understand God.",
  "After those things which will be, according to what will be, I do not know.",
  "Who has declared it to Him? Ecclesiastes said: Tell me the former things and the last things which are to come, and I will say, ‘You are gods’ (Eccl. 19).",
  "Hence, Isaiah also says: Tell us the former things, and we will set our hearts, and we will know, and the last things of those things which are to come, make them known to us.",
  "What is to come, tell us of the future, and we will say, ‘You are gods’ (Isaiah 41).",
  "From this, if anyone says the past, and can say the last things, God is.",
  "Who, then, can say except the Seraphim, Holy, holy, holy?",
  "The Seraphim uncovered a part of God, so to speak, His middle, and they called to each other, assisting God, and saying, Holy, holy, holy.",
  "They stand and move, they stand with God, they move demonstrating God.",
  "For understand, they cover faces, they cover feet, those things which are covered do not move, those things which fly are not covered, and they say: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.",
  "The advent of my Lord Jesus Christ is announced, and now the whole earth is full of His glory.",
  "Or certainly it is not yet full, but it will be filled when the prayer is completed, which the Lord Himself commanded us to pray, saying, ‘When you pray, say: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.’",
  "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6).",
  "In heaven the Father's will is still in force, but on earth His will has not yet been completed, as Jesus Himself, according to the dispensation of the flesh He had taken on, said: 'All power is given to Me, in heaven and on earth' (Matthew 28).",
  "Does He not have power on earth, who had it in heaven? And would He receive anything from the world, who came into His own?",
  "But in order for God to be believed on earth, as He was believed in heaven, He therefore took the power, the man Christ, which He had not had before, and until now He does not yet have all power on earth.",
  "For in those who sin, He does not yet reign; but when power is given to Him and all things are subjected to Him, then His power will be completed, and He will walk, subjecting all things to Himself (1 Cor. 15).",
  "Some, however, do not yet wish to be subject to Him, but still are subjected to His enemies.",
  "Let us, however, say: 'Is not my soul subject to God? (Psalm 53) For with God is my salvation.'",
    "IV",
      "And they flew with two, and one called to the other: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory.'",
  "And the threshold was lifted by the voice with which they cried out: the voice of Jesus Christ and the voice of the Holy Spirit.",
  "If any of us who are crying out hear the voice of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, the threshold is lifted, and it becomes higher than it was when it was lifted, as it was said: 'Lift up your gates, O princes, and be lifted up, you eternal gates, and the King of Glory shall come in' (Psalm 24).",
  "And the house was filled with smoke. The entire house was filled with the release of fire.",
  "But smoke is the vapor of fire.",
  "And I said: 'Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips.'",
  "I cannot understand why Isaiah humbled himself. However, it says: the testimony of Scripture is that his lips were cleansed by one of the Seraphim, who was sent to take away his sins.",
  "But one of the Seraphim, my Lord Jesus Christ, who was sent by the Father to take away our sins, says: 'Behold, I have taken away your iniquities, and I have cleansed your sins.'",
  "Do not think it a dishonor to the nature that the Son is sent by the Father.",
  "In order that you may understand the unity of the deity in the Trinity, only Christ in the present reading now forgives sins, and yet it is certain that sins are forgiven by the Trinity.",
  "For whoever believes in the One, believes in all.",
  "Therefore, let a pair of tongs be brought from the heavenly altar to touch my lips.",
  "If the tongs of the Lord touch my lips, they will cleanse them.",
  "Even if they cleanse them and circumcise them from vices, as we said earlier, I will open my mouth with the word of God, and no unclean word will proceed from my mouth anymore: because I am a man of unclean lips, and I live in the midst of a people with unclean lips.",
  "The Seraphim who were sent cleansed the lips of the Prophet, but did not cleanse the lips of the people.",
  "For he confessed that he had unclean lips, and dwelt in the midst of a people with unclean lips.",
  "But that which was sent by the Seraphim did not judge the people worthy to have their lips cleansed, and therefore they still act impiously, therefore they still resist my Lord Jesus Christ, still blaspheming Him with unclean lips.",
  "But I pray that the Seraphim, coming, may cleanse my lips.",
 "V",
    "And they flew with two, and one called to the other: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory.'",
  "And the threshold was lifted by the voice with which they cried out: the voice of Jesus Christ and the voice of the Holy Spirit.",
  "If any of us who are crying out hear the voice of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, the threshold is lifted, and it becomes higher than it was when it was lifted, as it was said: 'Lift up your gates, O princes, and be lifted up, you eternal gates, and the King of Glory shall come in' (Psalm 24).",
